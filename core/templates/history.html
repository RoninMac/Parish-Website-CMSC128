  <h1>Our Parish History</h1>

  <p>
    The history of the Virgen de la Candelaria Parish can be traced back to 1958, when Tranquilino Eusebio and Clara Mendiolia donated a 
    275-square-meter lot in Bagacay for the construction of a community chapel. The first chapel was built by Pedro C. Buclatan and later 
    maintained by Alberto Compas. This early chapel was originally dedicated to Saint Roch of Montpellier (San Roque), reflecting the strong 
    devotion of the barangay to its long-time patron.
  </p>

  <p>
    For several decades, the chapel served as the center of faith for families in Bagacay and nearby sitios. As the Catholic population 
    grew, pastoral needs expanded beyond what the simple wooden chapel could support.
  </p>

  <p>
    On December 7, 2005, the chapel was officially elevated to a mission station under the Archdiocese of Palo and given the title 
    Virgen de la Candelaria Mission Station. This marked the beginning of regular pastoral assignments, formal record-keeping, and a 
    more organized sacramental ministry. Our Lady of the Candles became the mission’s primary patroness, while Saint Roch remained the 
    secondary patron of the barangay.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mission station faced a major challenge when Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) struck on November 8, 2013, causing severe damage to 
    the chapel and surrounding areas. Community members, with the support of the Archdiocese, began efforts to rebuild and expand the 
    church to better serve the growing population of Bagacay.
  </p>

  <p>
    After years of ongoing development, the mission achieved a significant milestone on June 28, 2022, when it was officially erected as 
    a full-fledged parish: the Virgen de la Candelaria Parish of Bagacay, Tacloban City. Today, the parish oversees multiple chapels 
    across several barangays, serving as a spiritual home and center of pastoral activity for thousands of parishioners.
